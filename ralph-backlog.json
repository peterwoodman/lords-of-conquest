      "Update IsCityVictory() in internal/game/state.go to: return true if any player has cities >= VictoryCities AND has strictly more cities than all other players",
      "Update GetWinner() in internal/game/state.go to find the player who meets the new city victory condition (highest city count among those at/above threshold)",
      "Add unit tests for edge cases: two players tied at threshold, one player above threshold with clear lead, one player above while another is below but tied in count",
