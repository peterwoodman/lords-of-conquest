# Ralph Task Management

When adding, editing, or managing tasks in Ralph task files:

1. **Read `.ralph/task-schema.json`** to understand the required task format
2. **Analyze the codebase** to understand the scope and implications of the task
3. **Ask clarifying questions** before creating tasks if the requirements are ambiguous
4. **Split tasks** with natural boundaries into multiple smaller tasks

## Task File Locations

- `ralph-backlog.json` - Future tasks (add new tasks here)
- `ralph-todo.json` - Current sprint (Ralph processes these)
- `ralph-complete.json` - Completed tasks (moved automatically)
