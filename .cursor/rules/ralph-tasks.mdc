# Ralph Task Management

When adding, editing, or managing tasks in Ralph task files:

1. **Read `.ralph/task-schema.json`** to understand the required task format
2. **Analyze the codebase** to understand the scope and implications of the task
3. **STOP and ask clarifying questions** if any of these are unclear:
   - Implementation approach (multiple valid options exist)
   - Dimensions, sizes, quantities, or limits
   - User-facing behavior or UX decisions
   - Scope boundaries (what's included vs excluded)
   
   **Do NOT create tasks until ambiguous questions are answered.**
   
4. **Split large tasks** into smaller tasks with natural boundaries (separate UI, backend, integration)
5. **Record decisions** in the `decisions` field when choices are made during task creation
6. **Use dependencies** when tasks must be completed in order

## Task File Locations

- `ralph-backlog.json` - Future tasks (add new tasks here)
- `ralph-todo.json` - Current sprint (Ralph processes these)
- `ralph-complete.json` - Completed tasks (moved automatically)

## Priority Guidelines

- **high** - Blocks other work or fixes broken functionality
- **medium** - Standard feature work
- **low** - Nice-to-have, polish, or can wait
