# Lords of Conquest - Modern Remake

A modern client/server implementation of the classic 1986 strategy game "Lords of Conquest" by Electronic Arts, originally released for the C64 and Apple II.

## Project Overview

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: Go (Golang)
- **Client UI**: Ebitengine (2D game engine for Go)
- **Architecture**: Client/Server with authoritative server
- **Persistence**: SQLite (game state survives server restarts)
- **Networking**: WebSocket for real-time communication
- **Data Format**: JSON for protocol

### Architecture Overview

└─────────────────┘                    └─────────────────┘
```

### Async Turn-Based Model
- Games persist in SQLite database across server restarts
- Players don't need to stay connected - game pauses between turns
- All players must join before game starts (no late joins)
- When it's your turn, you can connect, take your turn, and disconnect
- Real-time updates via WebSocket when connected

### Simple Player Connection (No Accounts)
- Players enter a display name when connecting
- Server generates a **player token** (stored locally by client)
- Player token identifies you for reconnecting to your games
- **Join codes** for private games (e.g., `ABCD-1234`)
- Public games visible in lobby browser

## Game Rules Summary (from Original)

### Players
- 2-7 players (any combination of human/AI)
- AI personalities: Aggressive, Defensive, Passive
- Player order rotates each round

### Victory Conditions
- Build and maintain 3-8 cities (configurable)
- OR eliminate all opponents
- If multiple players reach city goal simultaneously, game continues until one drops below or builds another

### Resources
| Resource | Symbol | Used For |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Coal | �ite | Cities, Weapons |
| Gold | 🪙 | Cities, Weapons, Boats (universal currency) |
| Iron | �ite | Cities, Weapons |
| Timber | 🪵 | Cities, Boats |
| Horses | 🐴 | Special: spread on map, not stockpiled |

### Units & Buildings
| Unit | Cost | Strength | Notes |
|------|------|----------|-------|
| City | 1 Coal + 1 Gold + 1 Iron + 1 Wood (or 4 Gold) | +2 | Doubles adjacent resource production, one per territory |
| Weapon | 1 Coal + 1 Iron (or 2 Gold) | +3 | Move 1 space, one per territory |
| Boat | 3 Wood (or 3 Gold) | +2 | Unlimited water movement, can carry horse + weapon |
| Horse | Auto-produced | +1 | Move 2 spaces, can carry weapon, one per territory |

### Game Phases (per Round)
1. **Production** (25% chance to skip) - Resources generated based on controlled territories
2. **Trade** (3+ players only) - Negotiate resource exchanges
3. **Shipment** (25% chance to skip) - Move stockpile OR one unit
4. **Conquest** - Up to 2 attacks; failing first attack ends phase
5. **Development** - Purchase cities, weapons, boats

### Combat System
- **Attack Strength**: Sum of adjacent owned territories + unit bonuses
- **Defense Strength**: Territory (1) + adjacent owned territories + unit bonuses
- **Tie Resolution**: Configurable (attacker wins / defender wins / 50-50 random)
- **Bringing Forces**: Can bring one unit from non-adjacent territory for bonus
- **Failed Attack Penalty**: All brought-in units destroyed

### Game Levels
| Level | Resources | Boats | Transport |
|-------|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Beginner | Horses + Gold only | No | Stockpile only |
| Intermediate | All 5 | No | Stockpile only |
| Advanced | All 5 | Yes | Stockpile only |
| Expert | All 5 | Yes | Full (units movable) |

### Chance Settings
| Setting | Attack Success | Phase Skipping |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| Low | Attacker ≥ Defender | Never |
| Medium | Attacker > Defender (ties random) | Sometimes |
| High | Probability-based | Sometimes |

## Technical Decisions

### Why WebSocket?
- Real-time bidirectional communication
- Low latency for turn-based updates
- Wide client support
- Easy to debug with browser tools

### State Synchronization Strategy
- **Authoritative Server**: All game logic runs on server
- **Client Prediction**: None initially (turn-based doesn't need it)
- **State Broadcasting**: Full state sent after each action
- **Optimization**: Delta updates can be added later

### AI Architecture
- AI runs server-side only
- Same interface as human players
- Configurable "thinking time" for realism
- Three personalities affect:
  - Territory selection priorities
  - Attack/defense balance
  - Risk tolerance
  - Trade behavior

---

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow standard Go conventions
- Use `gofmt` and `golint`
- Meaningful package and function names
- Document public interfaces

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for game logic
- Integration tests for server
- Manual playtesting for client
- AI vs AI games for balance testing

### Version Control
- Feature branches
- Meaningful commit messages
- Tag releases
